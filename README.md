# recaptchaDemo-Streamlined
This is the same demo provided by Google for Recaptcha, minus eight vendor libraries that are not used in the Google demo, but are linked in unnecessarly by their Composer autoloader.  This demo performs exactly the same as the Google demo, but just leaves out the unused files they included via their Composer setup.
